## I'M NINIELLE
Or just Nielle. I am a SOFTWARE DEVELOPER by profession with a passion for the arts. This is my way of putting both together, experimenting, and rediscovering my identity given my skillset and what I want to put out in the world. It will go through many changes as I go, but I hope you enjoy what you see as it is today.

Welcome to my personal website, portfolio, and playground made with VueJS.

### DISCLAIMER: UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Please note that this website is still under construction. Well... it will always be under construction given this will be my ongoing portfolio AND playground for interaction design. But please do note that this is still early in development. It won't be the cleanest code, and there will be comments placed here and there for ideas or To-Do's. 

Every once in a while I might also place reminders for myself in this README, such as bugs to be fixed or features to be added. I hope you don't mind.
